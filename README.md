## My Portfolio - Module 2 Project

- I build this project with the intention of being able to display my work for potential employers or for other coders that would potentially like to colaborate with me
- Every line of code except for the reset.CSS sheet was built from scratch
- The problem I solved in this task was to make the webpage responsive  using flex box.
- I learned how much of a headache CSS is and I hope to never see it again 

## Usage 

-As far as usage goes just simple display my deployment link from github, open DevTools and then adjust the window size and watch the responsive layout work like magic. Street magic, not magic David Blane would conjur.
